# SQL-Assignments

Assignment 1: DDL Commands - This assignment demonstrates the use of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, and TRUNCATE by working with a table named STUDENT in a database called School. The assignment covers several operations like creating tables, modifying tables, renaming tables, deleting rows, and removing tables. 

Assignment 2: DDL Constraints - This assignment aims to create a database called Sales and perform various SQL operations on a table named Orders. The task includes the use of constraints such as Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null on specific columns.

Assignment 3: DML Commands - This assignment demonstrates the creation of tables with constraints, inserting data, and writing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate that data effectively.

Assignment 4: Querying Data - This assignment demonstrates the creation of the Country and Persons tables with appropriate data types and relationships. Inserted 10 rows into both tables for use in queries. Performed various SELECT operations, such as filtering data based on conditions, retrieving unique values, and using aliases for column names.

Assignment 5: Sorting and Grouping Data - This assignment demonstrates the usage of LEFT Function, CONCAT Function, COUNT DISTINCT, MAX Function, MIN Function, NULL Handling, COUNT Rows, LIMIT Clause, Random function, ORDER BY query, SUM, HAVING Clause, Grouping and Ordering. This set of SQL queries allows us to perform common operations on the Country and Persons tables, including aggregations, sorting, and filtering based on specific conditions.

Assignmnet 6: Joins and Unions - Demonstrates various SQL operations on two sample tables: Country and Persons. These operations include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, retrieving distinct country names, listing all country names including duplicates, and rounding numerical ratings.

Assignment 7: Functions - This explains the series of SQL operations performed on the Country and Persons tables. The operations include adding a new column, creating a user-defined function, querying for age, and performing string manipulations on the Country table.

Assignment 8: Subqueries and Views - This assignment covers tasks such as querying data, creating views, updating records, and performing aggregate functions.

Assignment 9: Stored Procedures - This assignment involves creating and invoking stored procedures for the Worker table. Tasks include adding new records, retrieving worker salaries, updating departments, counting workers in a department, and calculating average salaries by department.

Assignment 10: Triggers - This project involves creating a table named teachers and implementing several triggers to enforce business logic and maintain audit trails. Created triggers for inserting, deleting, and logging actions on the teachers table.
